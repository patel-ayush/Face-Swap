# SimSwap Implementation and Enhancement

In this project, we worked on an exciting advancement in the field of deep learning and GANs. We focused on implementing and enhancing [SimSwap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.06340), an innovative research paper that focuses on generalized and high-fidelity face swapping.

## Project Overview

SimSwap provides a novel and robust approach to the face swapping challenge. We decided to take this a step further by incorporating a face restoration Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) into the original framework. The addition of this face restoration GAN allows for even better preservation of facial attributes such as expression and gaze direction.

## Key Achievements

- Successful implementation of SimSwap, a cutting-edge technique for face swapping.
- Enhancement of the original framework with a face restoration GAN.
- Preservation of key facial attributes, improving the realism of the swapped faces.
- Conducted extensive experimentation with real-world faces.
- Showcased competitive identity performance, surpassing the capabilities of previous state-of-the-art methods.
